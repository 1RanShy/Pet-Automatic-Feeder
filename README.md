# Pet Automatic Feeder based on Raspberry Pi 

At present, pets are very common family members. But sometimes we have to go out and can't take care of them. What should we do when we are in such a rush? At this time, if there is an automatic feeding machine, it will deeply help us deal with this sad situation. 

So our idea is to design an automatic feeding machine, which can help people feed pets and understand the real-time status of pets when they are not at home and cannot take care of them.
