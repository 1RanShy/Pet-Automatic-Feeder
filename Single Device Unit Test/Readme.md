# Yhe problem I met
## Bluetooth Chip
~~~text
Bluetooth demo has worked properly. It takes me three days to fix it. Finally it works, but i still do not know why it can not work. Maybe just because the Serial Port is with different name

## Pump Driver

Need a PNP transistor. It's strong cutternt affects the sensors's normal work. Now before I turn on the sensors, I turn off the pump first.
